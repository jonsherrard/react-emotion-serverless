# Tapestry Lite

* Remove client side navigation
* Backwards compatible with existing `tapestry.config.js`
* Borrows heavily from `jaredpalmer/razzle` - using some of the presets and utils
* Upgrades Hapi to version `17`, should be able to port over most of the existing Tapestry server
* Webpack 4, includes hot server reloading and amazing speeds once cached
* WIP: Better error reporting

## Wishlist

* React Loadable included with server side reconciliation
* Swappable CSS solution - Potentially choosing Emotion/Styled as peer deps
* Efficient bundling spitting
* Streaming
* Super fast Hot Loading on the client
